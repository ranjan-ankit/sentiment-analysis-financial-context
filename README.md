# Text mining (sentiment analysis) in a financial context

This project investigates the sentiment regarding stocks from alternative data obtained from financial news headlines vendors (like Google News and Intrinio) and a financial social media website like StockTwits. 
StockTwits is a social media platform designed for sharing ideas between investors, traders, and entrepreneurs messages.

Employed NLTKâ€™s Sentiment Intensity Analyzer and FinBERT transformer to reduce uncertainty in sentiment by tagging 71% of the StockTwits messages obtained for 32 popular tickers.

This can be integrated with traditional quantitative analyses in a future study to create a formidable profitable trading strategy.

Refer to the report and code for a detailed workflow.
